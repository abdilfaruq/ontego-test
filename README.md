# Web Developer Project Test - Next.js Implementation

## Project Overview

This project aims to replicate the functionality and appearance of the [Ontego Mobile Devices page](https://ontego.de/sap_mobility/mobile-geraete.html) using Next.js and React.js. It includes replicating the appearance, animations, product details, filter functionality, and slide bar for price and weight.

## Features
- Appearance Duplication: The website replicates the appearance of the Ontego Mobile Devices page, including layout, styling, and visual elements.
- Animations: Animations are implemented to mimic those present on the original page, enhancing the user experience.
- Product Details: Detailed information about each mobile device is provided, including specifications, images, and descriptions.
- Filter Functionality:
  - Filters for available and unavailable devices are implemented. Unavailable devices cannot be clicked.
  - Active filters are visually represented, showing pictures of devices matching the filter criteria.
- Price List and Weight Slide Bar:
  - A price list and weight slide bar are provided, allowing users to filter devices based on price and weight criteria.
  - The slide bar functions similarly to other filters, providing a seamless user experience.
